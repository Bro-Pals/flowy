Process Sketcher is a small, simple java desktop app that is used to quickly create flowcharts.

My brother and I use flowcharts to keep track of our thinking while doing complicated tasks, but sometimes you just want to edit the flowchart you drew, or you want to improve its messy format. Instead of having to always redraw it by hand, you could create a digital copy that is easy to edit, access, and share with other people.
